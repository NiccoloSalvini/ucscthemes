**Answer to Exercise \@ref(exr:TestOneMeanExercisesEnergyIntake)**:
**1.** $H_0$: $\mu=7725$; $H_1$: $\mu\ne7725$ (two tailed).
**2.** $\bar{x} = 6753.64$ and $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}) = s/\sqrt{n} = 1142.123/\sqrt{11} = 344.363$.
**3.** $t = (6753.64 - 7725)/344.363 = -2.821$, as in output. 
       This 'large'; expect small $P$-value; software confirms this: two-tailed $P=0.018$.
**4.** Moderate evidence ($P = 0.018$) that the *mean* energy intake is not meeting the recommended daily energy intake (mean: 6753.6kJ; std. dev.: 1142.1kJ).
