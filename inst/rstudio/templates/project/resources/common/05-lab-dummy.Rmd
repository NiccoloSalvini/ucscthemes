::: {.exercise #TestOneMeanExercisesEnergyIntake}
The recommended daily energy intake for women
is 7725kJ
(for a particular cohort, in a particular country;
@data:Altman1991:PracticalStats).
The daily energy intake for 11 women was measured
to see if this is being adhered to.
The RQ is

> For this group of women, is the population mean daily energy intake 7725kJ?

The data collected are shown in
Table \@ref(tab:WomenEnergyData).

1. Write the hypotheses for answering this RQ.
1. Use the jamovi output 
   (Fig. \@ref(fig:WomenEnergyDescriptivesjamovi)),
   write down the value of 
   $\bar{x}$ and $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x})$.
1. Using this output, write down the $t$-value and the $P$-value.
1. Write a suitable conclusion.
1. Is the test statistically valid?
1. Sketch the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$.
