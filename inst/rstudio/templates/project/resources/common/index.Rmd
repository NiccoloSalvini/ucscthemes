## Honor Code {#honorcode}
Permissive but strict. If unsure, please ask the course staff!

- OK to search, ask in public about the systems we‚Äôre studying. Cite all the resources you reference.
E.g. if you read it in a paper, cite it. If you ask on Quora, include the link.
- <span style="color: red;">NOT OKAY</span> to ask someone to do assignments/projects for you, we are monitoring freelancing websites, we have a plethora of bots doing this job daily.
- <span style="color: green;">OK</span> to discuss questions with classmates. Disclose your discussion partners.
- <span style="color: red;">NOT OKAY</span> to blindly copy solutions from classmates-
- <span style="color: green;">OK</span>  to use existing solutions as part of your projects/assignments. Clarify your contributions.
- <span style="color: red;">NOT OKAY</span>to pretend that someone‚Äôs solution is yours.
- <span style="color: green;">OK</span>  to publish your final project after the course is over (we encourage that!)
- <span style="color: red;">NOT OKAY</span> to post your assignment solutions online.


## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reproducibility _(for developers)_

If you are willing to reproduce this book on your system please make sure to have installed `git`, `Rstudio` and relatively new version of R. Then follow the steps below.

### Usage of this repo

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

### Render book

clone the repo locally adn then access to the main directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/NiccoloSalvini/sbd_22-23.git
```

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

### Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```


## Colophon {#intro-colophon}

This book was authored using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) with [bs4 theme](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/bs4_book.html)
The [website](sbd-labs-22-23.netlify.app) is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and automatically updated after Netlify CI.
The complete source is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/NiccoloSalvini/sbd_22-23).
