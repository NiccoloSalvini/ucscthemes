# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

So there are a number of frequent troubles that students get most frequently stucked on. Here a collection of them with relative answer. What I generally suggest is to look for online answer just coping and pasting the error message from console to Google. **The most respected resource to look for when you are in trouble is [Stackovverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)**.


## Q n'A 

- I can't really install <package> via `install.packages("<package>")`,  it gives me some weird stuff I cant undestrand.

> have you check the syntax? Did you spell correctly the package name, capital letters matters you know it?
> still have the problem? try to install it from source, in most cases packages source code lies in GitHub. Look for the package author and name then do that: `library(devtools)` (if you still have not already installed the package `devtools` run `install.packages("devtools)` then execute `library(devtools)`). At this point run `install_github("<github package author username>/<package name>")`. This will install

- So I have a file in local inside my R project and when I execute `read.csv("<path to file>")` that says R cant find the files, so what's up?

> most likely the problem is in the Working Directory ( check what Working Directory means \@ref(workdir)). Load `here` with  `library(here)` (if you still have not already installed the package `here`, then execute before `install.packages("here")` then `library(devtools)`). At this point run `here()` and verify the file lies in the very same directory in the output.
